## IMPLEMENT Mode - Task: Implement Object Removal Feature
- **Overall Status:** CORE COMPLETE (Single Image - with known iterative removal bug)
- **Complexity Level:** Level 3
- **Sub-tasks:**
    - [x] Setup New Page Structure (`src/app/[locale]/object-removal/page.tsx`)
    - [x] Adapt Core Logic from POC (`src/app/lib/objectRemovalProcessing.ts`), POC file is (`src/app/[locale]/poc/MiganObjectRemoval.tsx`) is it easy to make a mistake so follow carefully the logic.
    - [x] Implement UI Components in Brutalist style, reuse existing (`Card`, `Button`, `ReactSketchCanvas`, Canvas)
    - [x] Implement State Management (single image initial)
    - [x] Integrate Control Flow (Upload, Remove, Reset, Download)
    - [x] Add Translations (`messages/en.json`)
    - [x] Refine Styling & Add Instructions
    - [x] Ensure Free/Pro Limits (1 image free, 100 pro - initial focus on 1)
    - [x] Update `progress.md` (Noting iterative bug)
    - [ ] (Future) Implement Multi-Image Support
    - [ ] (Future) Update other language files in `messages` folder

**Mode Transition:** IMPLEMENT → PLAN

## PLAN Mode - Task: Plan Multi-Image Object Removal
- **Overall Status:** PENDING
- **Complexity Level:** TBD (Likely Level 3 or 4)
- **Goal:** Allow users (primarily Pro) to upload multiple images, draw masks (individually or perhaps batch apply?), and process object removal on all selected images.
- **Sub-tasks:**
    - [ ] Define UI for multi-image selection and display (e.g., grid, carousel).
    - [ ] Determine mask application strategy (individual per image, potentially copy/paste or batch apply?).
    - [ ] Implement state management for multiple image objects (files, originals, processed, masks, statuses).
    - [ ] Adapt processing logic (`handleRemoveObjects`, `objectRemovalProcessing.ts`) for batch or sequential processing.
    - [ ] Implement UI for triggering batch processing.
    - [ ] Handle progress indication for batch jobs.
    - [ ] Implement download mechanism for multiple processed images (e.g., zip file).
    - [ ] Refine Free/Pro limits for batch processing (e.g., max number of images per batch for Pro).
    - [ ] Update translations.
    - [ ] Create Implementation Plan.
