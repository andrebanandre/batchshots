# Progress Log

## [Current Date] - Initial Memory Bank Population (IMPLEMENT Mode)

- **Task:** Populate Memory Bank files based on existing project analysis.
- **Files Analyzed:**
    - `package.json`
    - `README.md`
    - `next.config.ts`
    - `tsconfig.json`
- **Memory Bank Files Updated:**
    - `techContext.md`: Populated with core stack, dependencies, config summaries.
    - `projectbrief.md`: Populated with core goal, features, tech summary.
- **Next Steps:** Populate `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `activeContext.md` based on further analysis or user input. Update `tasks.md`.

## [Current Date] - Memory Bank Population - Phase 2 (IMPLEMENT Mode)

- **Task:** Continue Populating Memory Bank files.
- **Input:** User provided `src/app/components` & `src/app/api` listings and context (Brutalist style, Client-side ONNX).
- **Analysis:** Inferred features, system patterns, and backend interactions from file/directory names.
- **Memory Bank Files Updated:**
    - `techContext.md`: Added notes on styling and client-side ONNX Runtime.
    - `productContext.md`: Populated with features inferred from components/APIs.
    - `systemPatterns.md`: Populated with architecture/patterns inferred from analysis and context.
    - `activeContext.md`: Updated to reflect current focus on src analysis.
- **Next Steps:** Determine next steps for deeper analysis (e.g., reading specific component/API files) or conclude initial population phase. Update `tasks.md`.

## [Current Date] - OpenCV Deep Dive (IMPLEMENT Mode)

- **Task:** Analyze OpenCV.js usage across specified files and POCs.
- **Files Analyzed:** `ImageProcessingControls.tsx`, `imageProcessing.ts`, `ImagePreview.tsx`, `imageHelper.ts`, `ImageProcessingContext.tsx`, `poc/MiganObjectRemoval.tsx`, `poc/UltraSharp.tsx`.
- **Key Findings:**
    - OpenCV is used conditionally for core image adjustments (brightness, contrast, HSL, RGB, sharpen) and resizing in `imageProcessing.ts`, with Canvas API fallbacks.
    - OpenCV is used for ONNX model pre-processing (`cv.imread`, `cv.resize`, `cv.convertTo`) in `imageHelper.ts`.
    - OpenCV is used conditionally for ONNX model post-processing (color preservation) in `imageHelper.ts`.
    - Watermarking and format conversion primarily use Canvas API.
    - `poc/MiganObjectRemoval.tsx` explicitly initializes OpenCV, likely for mask/image processing alongside its ONNX model. `poc/UltraSharp.tsx` focuses on ONNX but relies on `imageHelper.ts` which uses OpenCV.
    - Specific functions identified: `cv.imread`, `cv.resize`, `cv.convertTo`, `cv.cvtColor`, `cv.GaussianBlur`, `cv.addWeighted`, `cv.split`, `cv.merge`, `cv.imshow`.
- **Memory Bank Files Updated:**
    - `techContext.md`: Added details on OpenCV conditional usage, functions, initialization, and relationship with ONNX.
    - `systemPatterns.md`: Added details on the conditional processing pipeline, ONNX interaction, Canvas fallbacks, and POC experiments.
- **Next Steps:** Update `tasks.md`; Conclude Memory Bank population or identify further deep dives. 

## [Current Date] - Planning Object Removal Feature (PLAN Mode)

- **Task:** Create implementation plan for Object Removal feature based on POC (`MiganObjectRemoval.tsx`).
- **Complexity Level:** Level 3 (New feature integration, UI/state complexity).
- **Plan Summary:**
    - Create new page `src/app/[locale]/object-removal/page.tsx`.
    - Adapt core ONNX/Canvas logic from POC into `src/app/lib/objectRemovalProcessing.ts`.
    - Implement UI using `Card`, `Button`, `ReactSketchCanvas`.
    - Handle state for image, mask, processing status.
    - Integrate core logic (upload, remove, reset, download).
    - Handle Free/Pro limits (start with single image focus).
    - Add translations to `messages/en.json`.
    - Style consistently.
- **Next Steps:** Update `tasks.md`, Transition to IMPLEMENT Mode.

## [Current Date] - Implement Object Removal Feature (IMPLEMENT Mode - Level 3)

- **Task:** Implement the single-image object removal feature page.
- **Status:** Core functionality COMPLETE.
- **Known Issue:** Iterative removal on the same image does not correctly use the previously processed result as the source for the next operation.
- **Implementation Details:**
    - Created `src/app/[locale]/object-removal/page.tsx`.
    - Created `src/app/lib/objectRemovalProcessing.ts` with core ONNX/Canvas logic.
    - Implemented UI using `Card`, `Button`, `ReactSketchCanvas`, handling state with `useState`.
    - Integrated control flow: image upload, mask drawing, object removal processing, reset, download.
    - Added English translations to `messages/en.json` under `ObjectRemovalPage` namespace.
    - Applied basic Brutalist styling and added instructions.
    - Enforced single-image limit for free users.
- **Files Modified:**
    - `src/app/[locale]/object-removal/page.tsx` (Created & Implemented)
    - `src/app/lib/objectRemovalProcessing.ts` (Created & Implemented)
    - `messages/en.json` (Added translations)
    - `src/app/components/Loader.tsx` (Added className prop)
- **Next Steps:** Update `tasks.md`. Transition to PLAN mode to define multi-image support.
